# VelocidroneWebApp
A web app for reciept of race data from Velocidrone, as well as creation of events, display of said race data, etc

# Getting it running
The companion project to this is https://github.com/eedok/VelocidroneWebSocketConsumer which is an implementation of the WebSocket consumption from Velocidrone and if it doesn't currently, will include a "proxy.js" that has been built specifically to work in conjunction with this web app.

Will fill out the rest later...
